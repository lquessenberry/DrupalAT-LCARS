Introduction:

The DrupalAT-LCARS theme is an effort to create an updated look to Michael Okuda's LCARS interface design made famous and introduced in Star Trek: The Next Generation as a control panel for various computer interfaces on the ship. As a fan of Star Trek and as a gamer on Star Trek Online, I decided to create a Drupal theme that mimics the design of the new interface in Star Trek Online. I chose Adaptive Theme as my framework so that the theme can be used in responsive web designs for multiple devices.

The Files:

The file is a simple CSS file that is an extra file used in AT based themes called responsive.custom.css. The file contains many overrides of default classes for the Adaptive Theme Subtheme that is shipped with Adaptive Themes module.

To Install:

Simply overwrite the default CSS file (responsive.custom.css) inside of your theme's CSS folder with the contents of this file.

I also used the @Font-Your-Face module and declared the headers to use 'Michroma Font' (http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Michroma) and for the text body, the 'Play Font' (http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Play)

File location:

sites/all/themes/adaptivetheme/at_subtheme/css

Future Plans:

This CSS file will eventually be rolled into a more permanent child theme that can be installed alongside Adaptive Theme complete with an info file and proper thumbnails. For now it's safe to just install the CSS file to see the changes.

List of updates to come:

- Theme Packaging and Submission to Drupal
- Thumbnail for Drupal Theme Identification
- Corrections to layout for phone devices. (Some layouts are showing wrong rounded edges and will be corrected with media queries.)

Thanks for checking me out. I am a huge Star Trek fan and avid player of Start Trek Online. I am also a huge fan of Drupal and Adaptive Themes and have been using both of these fine projects for quite some time. 

I'd like to thank Jeff Burnz for Adaptive Theme development which can be found here. https://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme

I'd also like to thank the Drupal support community and drupal.org community for making Drupal a big part of my life.
